      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I'd be Bence Nagy, and oh my, what a great question! A novice developer and designer, at the very least&mdash;I have fun hacking things together in my spare time, but not much else, for I am still just a high school student. In my free time I'm busy struggling to decide which university to go to, while doing some freelance work every now and then.

      <h2>Who am I, really?</h2>
      <p>
        An avid gamer, for the most part. Most of the time I play Dota 2, or Team Fortress 2, kind of competitively (but still, horribly). When I'm not busy with those, I love checking out the latest indie/artsy games out there; I'm a huge advocate for both games being viewed as an art form, and competitive gaming.
