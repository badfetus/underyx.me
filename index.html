      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I'd be <span itemprop="name"><span itemprop="givenName">Bence</span> <span itemprop="familyName">Nagy</span></span>, and oh my, what a great question! A software engineer who'd love to think he's good at design, too. I quit high school halfway through my senior year (back in 2013) to go work as an engineer at <a href="https://allmyles.com/">Allmyles</a>, while I got my high school diploma on my own. My responsibilities at Allmyles crept up on me so much that I've pretty much been the technical lead for a while now. I mainly use Python, but I'm always eager to experiment with the latest craze amongst hackers.

      <h2>Who am I, really?</h2>
      <p>
        An avid gamer, for the most part, under the alias '<span itemprop="additionalName">underyx</span>'. Most of the time I play Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and Team Fortress 2 &mdash; all of which I'm horrible at, even after thousands of hours spent on them over the years (weirdly enough, that didn't stop me from dabbling in playing competitively for a bit over a year). When I'm not busy with those games, I love checking out the latest indie/artsy games out there; I'm a huge advocate for both games being viewed as a form of art, and competitive gaming.
